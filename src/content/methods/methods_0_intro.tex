\chapter{Methodology}
\label{methods:intro}
In this chapter, we will take a closer look at the methodological background of our work, on which the experiments in \autoref{experiments:intro} are based. In particular, we will introduce the Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) we use and their model architecture and discuss some of the peculiarities of NCAs. To do this, we will first introduce the idea of Cellular Automata (CAs) in \autoref{methods:CA} and then, building on that, in \autoref{methods:NCA} Neural Cellular Automata itself. We will first look at NCAs in general and then present the specific architectures we use. After that, in \autoref{methods:NQM} we will discuss the NCA Quality Metric (NQM) as a measure of the variance between different model outputs, which is the basis of our experiments and the central research topic of this thesis. Finally, in \autoref{methods:Robust}, we describe our approaches to evaluate robustness against artifacts and domain shifts.
